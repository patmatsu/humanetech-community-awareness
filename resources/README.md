# General resources

This project section is for the collection of general information, like video's, images, and articles, that can be useful to future campaigns and deliverables.

(Note: As the number of resources linked from this page grows, we'll categorize them under sub-headers)

## Video's

- YouTube "[This Panda Is Dancing - Time Well Spent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf9ZhU7zF8s)," 3.48min. by Max Stossel (CHT), Sander van Dijk
  - In the Attention Economy, technology and media are designed to maximize our screen-time. But what if they were designed to help us live by our values?
  
- Vimeo "[Walk with Me](http://walkwithmefilm.com/trailer/)," 2:13 min. by Marc J. Francis, Max Pugh
  - Trailer for a documentary film, described as a "journey into mindfulness," on Buddhist leader Thich Nhat Hanh.
  
- "[Hyper Reality](http://hyper-reality.co/)," 6:15 min. by Keiichi Matsuda
  - "Our physical and virtual realities are becoming increasingly intertwined. Technologies such as VR, augmented reality, wearables, and the internet of things are pointing to a world where technology will envelop every aspect of our lives. It will be the glue between every interaction and experience, offering amazing possibilities, while also controlling the way we understand the world. _Hyper-Reality_ attempts to explore this exciting but dangerous trajectory. It was crowdfunded, and shot on location in Medell√≠n, Colombia."
  - Note that on the landing page, there is a list of **credits, cast, crews, and backers,** which is important for us to refer to in preparing our RFPs.
