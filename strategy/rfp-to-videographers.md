Dear [Name]:

**Re: Request for proposal to produce a short video commissioned by the Humane Tech Community**

The Humane Tech Community ("HTC"), founded by The Center for Humane Technology (www.humanetech.com), is a grassroots movement whose purpose is to "Re-align Technology with Humanity's Best Interests". Based upon four pillars---namely, Awareness, Regulation, Participation, and Realization---the community is actively involved in numerous initiatives aimed at changing the status quo.

One of these initiatives consists of structuring, organizing, and implementing several campaigns to raise public awareness of the potential pitfalls of rapid, drastic technology adoption and its significant impact on our society.

The first campaign, named "Reality Shock," involves the production and distribution of a series of short, dramatic videos (each a few minutes long) aimed at shocking the audience into introspection and reflection on the new hazards presented by technology (e.g., smartphone and social media addictions, privacy invasion, social-credit systems, etc.) and how people may be personally affected.

We believe that to achieve maximum distribution and impact, these videos should be produced by a professional studio. We would like to invite your company to submit a detailed proposal for the production of one of these videos, _A Coffee Place_ (working title).

HTC members will assess your proposal on the basis of your preliminary ideas, experience with similar projects, schedule, and budget.

As you will understand, the HTC as a community of volunteers will pay special attention to the budget you propose to make the video. We hope that the final deliverable can be made without sacrificing the high quality we prefer.

If your company sympathizes with our cause, or believes, as we do, that this project has a high potential to be widely distributed and reach millions, we also invite you to consider working with us on a partnership basis, where you will essentially produce the video for free, in exchange for special credits and other advantages to be discussed. 

You will find attached the following information to help you prepare your proposal:

1. Campaign theme, description, and objectives
2. Video concept, script, and objectives
3. Scope of work
4. Key issues
5. Structure of your proposal

Should you have any questions about this project, please contact one of the following HTC representatives:

- Contact 1
- Contact 2
- Contact 3

We hope you will find this project as exciting as we do and look forward to working with you.

### Attachment 1

#### Campaign Theme: _Mankind 2.0_

Objective: Raising awareness of the impact of technology on our society by producing videos of unsettling or jarring experiences resulting from the conflict between promised results and actual results. Subjects to be covered in this campaign include smartphone and social media addiction, privacy invasion, and social-credit systems.

Objectives

- Shock the audience without imposing an agenda or lecturing the target audience
- Lead to introspection and questioning by asking people if they are comfortable with the impact of these forms of technology on their lives
- Make the audience think and reach their own conclusions
- Provoke, rather than convince

#### "Reality Shock" Campaign 

Series of short, dramatic videos that illustrate the pervasive use of technology and rapid, drastic changes in our society and provoke people to ask "Are we really fine with this?"

Approach

Argumentation, reasoning and "lectures" only go so far to change people's mind a behaviors; hence we propose to first trigger an "emotional" response. The campaign will feature short videos (2-3 minutes each) that aim to be dramatic and impactful through the combined use of words, cinematography, and music. It does not aim to explicitly pursue a specific agenda, impose on the audience a particular message, or impose a "lecture." Rather, it aims to provoke introspection by telling provocative stories, the conclusions of which are left to the audience. Why is it important to adopt a "neutral" approach based on providing factual observations in a spectacular and dramatic form? Our guiding principle is that we will not change our behaviors on the mere basis of facts and reason if we have no motivation to challenge our thinking in the first place. The dramatic videos aim to shock and leave a strong impression that ideally will lead to wondering where each of us stands in the widespread use of technology.

#### A Coffee Place

Short video depicting the rapid and drastic growth in smartphone addiction.

Objectives

- Shock the audience into realizing that our world has changed so much and so quickly since the smartphone's advent.
- Contrast previous times and social habits with the now universal addiction to our devices.
- Get the audience to ponder whether we should be more than a bit concerned about such drastic changes to our society.

Concept

Let us look at how our pastimes have changed by considering a scene at a cafe that actually represents two decades. From leisurely and seemingly tranquil activities, we have become increasingly absorbed in our phones, in the process building the wealthiest and most powerful companies in the world’s history. At the end, we realize our phones have become our only source of gratification.

Script

The whole scene takes place in one of those common coffee-place terraces. This used to be the place for spending time leisurely with friends, reading newspapers or a book, and watching people.

The music starts slowly. Maybe only a few patrons (2 or 3, importantly most of them in their early twenties as this is not a cross-generational issue), all of them engaging in above-mentioned activities.

As the music gathers pace and grows, more and more patrons of all ages and all backgrounds (students, business people, etc), alone or in groups, sit in, some of them picking up their phones and getting busy. The music grows louder, more and more patrons arrive, this time already holding their phones as they arrive. We start superimposing data (in the form of these high-tech transparent windows) pertaining to each patron that is relevant for harvesting, and showing growing profits, market caps for tech companies, etc. 

Once the music finally calms down in the very last few seconds (just before 2:37), one person who was engrossed with his/her phone looks up from his/her screen, and realizes there is not a soul around.

We conclude with showing a question for the viewer on these few final notes.

Music

First 2:37 mins. of Beethoven’s Symphony 7 Movement 2 (“allegretto”)

#### Scope of work

- Propose finalized storyboard
- Possible shooting locations
- Engage figurants and actors of all age groups (i.e. from 20 to 60)
- Propose cinematic effects to enhance video impact, in sync with proposed music theme
- After shooting, cooperate with HTC on the producing the final product

#### Key issues

- The script is simple given the proposed duration (2:37). It is on purpose as we want to impress a slow and steady progression (accentuated by the music going crescendo). Hence it will be key to enhance the appeal of the video by incorporating cinematic effects and/or suggesting additions to the script
- Of particular important, we want the video to be as "neutral" as possible (while obviously leading the audience to realize something feels wrong about the rapid changes by technology). This means for instance that actors engrossed with their phones should be viewed under a neutral light.

#### Elements of your proposal

- Introduction, confirming your understanding of our themes, concepts and importantly, objectives of our campaign and proposed video
- Your preliminary views on key issues (see above), comments on the script, and ideas about cinematic effects
- Your preliminary views on possible shooting locations
- Your preliminary views on the availability of actors/figurants.
- Your shooting schedule
- Your rough budget
